# Global Trends

Building a public dashboard that keeps track of global trending keywords/entities in real-time by countries. historic and advanced queries available through paywalled API.

## Roadmap

In this repo, the project hs been developed to the point where it maintains a real-time data object of trending keywords grouped by countries and sorted. The data mechanism is fully developed.

But for an easier code management and UI, we integrated it into a new Angular SSR project in another repo.

It is here [NEW REPO](https://github.com/newben420/global_trends_full)
